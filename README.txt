js: This folder will hold all of your custom JavaScript files, in which you will write the script to make your site—including its web map—dynamic and interactive.

lib: This folder holds any third-party JavaScript code libraries you choose to download and host. These will eventually include jQuery, Leaflet, D3, and others. Some code libraries come with their own css stylesheets and/or images; leave these within the library's directory and place the entire directory within the lib folder.

css: This folder will hold all of your custom CSS stylesheets.

data: You won't always need to keep something in this folder, but it's here because you'll need it when you add data to create your thematic web maps. This folder may hold CSV, GeoJSON, and other formats that we'll cover later. You might also wish to keep original ESRI Shapefiles in it; these should go in a shapefiles subdirectory within the data folder.

img: This is where you keep the images you will be using in your site.
